## 4.4. Route

The Hyperloop will be capable of traveling between Los Angeles and San Francisco in approximately 35 minutes. This requirement tends to size other portions of the system. Given the performance specification of the Hyperloop, a route has been devised to satisfy this design requirement. The Hyperloop route should be based on several considerations, including:

1. Maintaining the tube as closely as possible to existing rights of way (e.g., following the I-5).
2. Limiting the maximum capsule speed to 760 mph (1,220 kph) for aerodynamic considerations.
3. Limiting accelerations on the passengers to 0.5g.
4. Optimizing locations of the linear motor tube sections driving the capsules.
5. Local geographical constraints, including location of urban areas, mountain ranges, reservoirs, national parks, roads, railroads, airports, etc. The route must respect existing structures.

For aerodynamic efficiency, the velocity of a capsule in the Hyperloop is typically:

* 300 mph (480 kph) where local geography necessitates a tube bend radii < 1.0 mile (1.6 km)
* 760 mph (1,220 kph) where local geography allows a tube bend > 3.0 miles (4.8 km) or where local geography permits a straight tube.

These bend radii have been calculated so that the passenger does not experience inertial accelerations that exceed 0.5g. This is deemed the maximum inertial acceleration that can be comfortably sustained by humans for short periods. To further reduce the inertial acceleration experienced by passengers, the capsule and/or tube will incorporate a mechanism that will allow a degree of ‘banking’.

The Hyperloop route was created by the authors using Google Earth.

### 4.4.1. Route Optimization

In order to avoid bend radii that would lead to uncomfortable passenger inertial accelerations and hence limit velocity, it is necessary to optimize the route. This can be achieved by deviating from the current highway system, earth removal, constructing pylons to achieve elevation change or tunneling.

The proposed route considers a combination of 20, 50, and 100 ft (6, 15, and 30 m, respectively) pylon heights to raise and lower the Hyperloop tube over geographical obstacles. A total tunnel length of 15.2 miles (24.5 km) has been

included in this optimization where extreme local gradients (>6%) would preclude the use of pylons. Tunneling cost estimations are estimated at $50 million per mile ($31 million per km). The small diameter of the Hyperloop tube should keep tunneling costs to a far more reasonable level than traditional automotive and rail tunnels.

The route has been divided into the following sections:

* Los Angeles/Grapevine – South and North
* I-5
* I-580/San Francisco Bay

**Summary**

* 300 mph (480 kph) for the Los Angeles Grapevine South section at 0.5g. Total time of 167 seconds.
* 555 mph (890 kph) for the Los Angeles Grapevine North section at 0.5g. Total travel time of 435 seconds.
* 760 mph (1,220 kph ) along I-5 at 0.5g. Total travel time of 1,518 seconds.
* 555 mph (890 kph) along I-580 slowing to 300 mph (480 kph) into San Francisco.

Total travel time of 2,134 seconds (35 minutes)

### 4.4.2. Station Locations

The major stations for Hyperloop are suggested based on high traffic regions between major cities. The largest cities by metro population in California according to 2010 to 2012 estimates from various sources (Table 7) are considered for station locations.

Table 7. Largest cities in California by 2013 population.

City | Population (millions)
:--- | ---:
Los Angeles | 18.1
San Francisco/San Jose | 8.4
San Diego | 3.1
Sacramento | 2.6
Fresno | 1.1

Stations at these major population centers are considered for Hyperloop. One additional traffic corridor to consider is between Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada with a metro population of 2.1 million. Significant traffic is present through this corridor on a weekly basis.

<figure>
	<img src="../assets/figures/32.jpg" alt="Suggested Hyperloop route map (map courtesy of Google Maps).">
	<figcaption>Figure 32. Suggested Hyperloop route map (map courtesy of Google Maps).</figcaption>
</figure>

The traffic between Los Angeles, California and San Francisco/San Jose, California is estimated to be at least 6 million travelers per year. This possibly represents the busiest corridor of travel in California. Travel along this corridor is anticipated to increase with completion of the Hyperloop due to both decreased travel time and decreased travel cost.

Additional Hyperloop stations are suggested considered at the following major population centers:

1. San Diego, California:
	a. Connects to Los Angeles, California main station.
	b. Capsule departures every 5 minutes.
	c. Transports around 3 million people per year.
2. Las Vegas, Nevada: Suggested main route Suggested main stations Proposed branches Proposed branch stations
	a. Connects to Los Angeles, California main station.
	b. Uses a portion of the San Diego branch route near Los Angeles and tube branches near San Bernardino, California.
	c. Capsule departures every 8 minutes.
	d. Transports around 1.8 million people per year.
3. Sacramento, California:
	a. Connects to San Francisco, California main station.
	b. Uses a portion of the main route near San Francisco and tube branches near Stockton, California.
	c. Capsule departures every 15 minutes.
	d. Transports around 1 million people per year.
4. Fresno, California:
	a. Connects to both San Francisco, California and Los Angeles, California main stations.
	b. Los Angeles bound travelers:
		i. Uses the main route closer to San Francisco plus a small branch along State Route 41 near Fresno.
		ii. Capsule departures every 15 minutes.
		iii. Transports around 1 million people per year.
	c. San Francisco bound travelers:
		i. Uses the main route closer to Los Angeles plus a small branch along State Route 41 near Fresno.
		ii. Capsule departures every 30 minutes.
		iii. Transports around 0.5 million people per year.
