## 4. Hyperloop Transportation System

Hyperloop (Figure 2 through Figure 3) is a proposed transportation system for traveling between Los Angeles, California, and San Francisco, California in 35 minutes. The Hyperloop consists of several distinct components, including:

1. Capsule:
	a. Sealed capsules carrying 28 passengers each that travel along the interior of the tube depart on average every 2 minutes from Los Angeles or San Francisco (up to every 30 seconds during peak usage hours).
	b. A larger system has also been sized that allows transport of 3 full size automobiles with passengers to travel in the capsule.
	c. The capsules are separated within the tube by approximately 23 miles (37 km) on average during operation.
	d. The capsules are supported via air bearings that operate using a compressed air reservoir and aerodynamic lift.
2. Tube:
	a. The tube is made of steel. Two tubes will be welded together in a side by side configuration to allow the capsules to travel both directions.
	b. Pylons are placed every 100 ft (30 m) to support the tube.
	c. Solar arrays will cover the top of the tubes in order to provide power to the system.
3. Propulsion:
	a. Linear accelerators are constructed along the length of the tube at various locations to accelerate the capsules.
	b. Stators are located on the capsules to transfer momentum to the capsules via the linear accelerators.
4. Route:
	a. There will be a station at Los Angeles and San Francisco. Several stations along the way will be possible with splits in the tube.
	b. The majority of the route will follow I-5 and the tube will be constructed in the median.

In addition to these aspects of the Hyperloop, safety and cost will also be addressed in this study.

The Hyperloop is sized to allow expansion as the network becomes increasingly popular. The capacity would be 840 passengers per hour which more than sufficient to transport all of the 6 million passengers traveling between Los Angeles and San Francisco areas per year. In addition, this accounts for 70% of those travelers to use the Hyperloop during rush hour. The lower cost of traveling on Hyperloop is likely to result in increased demand, in which case the time between capsule departures could be significantly shortened.
