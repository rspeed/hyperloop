## 4.3. Propulsion

The propulsion system has these basic requirements:

1. Accelerate the capsule from 0 to 300 mph (480 kph) for relatively low speed travel in urban areas.
2. Maintain the capsule at 300 mph (480 kph) as necessary, including during ascents over the mountains surrounding Los Angeles and San Francisco.
3. To accelerate the capsule from 300 to 760 mph (480 to 1,220 kph) at 1g at the beginning of the long coasting section along the I-5 corridor.
4. To decelerate the capsule back to 300 mph (480 kph) at the end of the I- 5 corridor.

The Hyperloop as a whole is projected to consume an average of 28,000 hp (21 MW). This includes the power needed to make up for propulsion motor efficiency (including elevation changes), aerodynamic drag, charging the batteries to power on-board compressors, and vacuum pumps to keep the tube evacuated. A solar array covering the entire Hyperloop is large enough to provide an annual average of 76,000 hp (57 MW), significantly more than the Hyperloop requires.

Since the peak powers of accelerating and decelerating capsules are up to 3 times the average power, the power architecture includes a battery array at each accelerator, allowing the solar array to provide only the average power needed to run the system. Power from the grid is needed only when solar power is not available.

This section details a large linear accelerator, capable of the 300 to 760 mph (480 to 1,220 kph) acceleration at 1g. Smaller accelerators appropriate for urban areas and ascending mountain ranges can be scaled down from this system.

The Hyperloop uses a linear induction motor to accelerate and decelerate the capsule. This provides several important benefits over a permanent magnet motor:

* Lower material cost – the rotor can be a simple aluminum shape, and does not require rare-earth elements.
* Lighter capsule.
* Smaller capsule dimensions.
* The lateral forces exerted by the stator on the rotor though low at 0.9 lb<sub>f</sub>/ft (13 N/m) are inherently stabilizing. This simplifies the problem of keeping the rotor aligned in the air gap.

Each accelerator has two 65 MVA inverters, one to accelerate the outgoing capsule, and one to capture the energy from the incoming capsule. Inverters in the 10+ MVA power range are not unusual in mining, drives for large cargo ships, and railway traction. Moreover, 100+ MVA drives are commercially available. Inexpensive semiconductor switches allow the central inverters to energize only the section of track occupied by a capsule, improving the power factor seen by the inverters.

The inverters are physically located at the highest speed end of the track to minimize conductor cost.

### 4.3.1. Capsule Components (Rotor)

The rotor of the linear accelerators is very simple – an aluminum blade 49 ft (15 m) long, 1.5 ft (0.45 m) tall, and 2 in. (50 mm) thick. Current flows mainly in the outer 0.4 in. (10 mm) of this blade, allowing it to be hollow to decrease weight and cost.

The gap between the rotor and the stator is 0.8 in. (20 mm) on each side. A combination of the capsule control system and electromagnetic centering forces allows the capsule to safely enter, stay within, and exit such a precise gap.

### 4.3.2. Tube Components (Stator)

The stator is mounted to the bottom of the tube over the entire 2.5 miles (4.0 km) it takes to accelerate and decelerate between 300 and 760 mph (480 and 1,220 km). It is approximately 1.6 ft (0.5 m) wide (including the air gap) and 4.0 in. (10 cm) tall, and weighs 530 lb/ft (800 kg/m).

Laid out symmetrically on each side of the rotor, its electrical configuration is 3-phase, 1 slot per pole per phase, with a variable linear pitch (1.3 ft or 0.4 m maximum). The number of turns per slot also varies along the length of the stator, allowing the inverter to operate at nearly constant phase voltage, which simplifies the power electronics design. The two halves of the stator require bracing to resist the magnetic forces of 20 lb<sub>f</sub>/ft (300N/m) that try to bring them together.

### 4.3.3. Energy Storage Components

Energy storage allows this linear accelerator to only draw its average power of 8,000 hp (6 MW) (rather than the peak power of 70,000 hp or 52 MW) from its solar array.

Building the energy storage element out of the same lithium ion cells available in the Tesla Model S is economical. A battery array with enough power capability to provide the worst-case smoothing power has a lot of energy – launching 1 capsule only uses 0.5% of the total energy – so degradation due to cycling is not an issue. With proper construction and controls, the battery could be directly connected to the HVDC bus, eliminating the need for an additional DC/DC converter to connect it to the propulsion system.

### 4.3.4. Cost

As described above, the propulsion elements on the capsule are limited to the rotor and not expected to cost any more than $3 million USD for the overall system. The bulk of the propulsion cost is for the stator elements connected to the track and for the inverters to drive the stator. All tube-side propulsion costs together for linear accelerators add up to $140 million USD.

This cost is roughly divided as followed:

* Stator and structure materials = 54%
* Power electronics (traction inverters, grid tie inverters) = 33%
* Energy storage = 13%

The solar array and associated electronics provide an average power of 28,000 hp (21 MW) and are expected to cost approximately $210 million USD.

### 4.3.5. Propulsion for Passenger Plus Vehicle System

Compared to the passenger-only capsule, the passenger plus vehicle capsule weighs more, requires a more powerful compressor, and has 50% higher total drag. This increases both the peak and continuous power requirements on the propulsion system, so that the Hyperloop now consumes an average of 66,000 hp (49 MW). However, there is still more than enough solar power available on the wider tubes (122,000 hp or 91 MW, on average) to provide this.

The expected total cost for this larger propulsion system is $691 million USD, divided as follows:

* 66,000 hp (49 MW) (yearly average) solar array: $490 million USD
* Propulsion system total: $200 million USD
* Stator and structure materials = 47%
* Power electronics = 37%
* Energy storage = 16%
